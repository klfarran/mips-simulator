# MIPS simulator

### MIPS Simulator is a program that reads MIPS assembly instructions in hexadecimal format and interprets them based on their opcode, instruction type, and input/output registers. 

### The simulator modifies manually allocated "program memory" accordingly, allowing users to see how MIPS instructions interact with memory and registers.
