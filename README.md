# MIPS simulator

### MIPS Simulator is a C++ program that reads MIPS assembly instructions in hexadecimal format and interprets and executes them based on their opcode, instruction type, and input/output registers.

### A more developed version of this project, which sends the instructions through the MIPS pipeline stages, is currently under development
